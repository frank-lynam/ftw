# Frank's Terrible WebUI
A thing that turns python files into websites super easy

## Concept

- No non-standard dependencies
- Single python file
- Can just add decorator (or not!) and works
- Can add static files if you want
- Define custom widgets using "variable name": {"type": "range", "min": 1} etc
- Handler for file uploads
- Rest api and web page
- Command line argument for path to code
- Open API maybe
- Threaded tasks that run in the background
- All endpoints are immediate

# To do

Allow custom index
Pass files a file like in memory
Add q endpoint
Break header stuff into new method
Store last used parameters in local storage
